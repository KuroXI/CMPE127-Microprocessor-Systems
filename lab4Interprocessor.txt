CMPE 127 Lab 4 Optional Lab on Interprocessor Communications (5 bonus points) 
Design and build an interprocessor communication demo system using your LPC1769 
board as a host and another micro-processor system as a client. You can either use 
LPC1769 CPU module, or Arduino as a client. Your design and prototype system will 
have to realize the following functions: 
1. Use LPC1769 as a host and UART as communication protocol (or you can use MAX485
to build RS485 interface between two systems) to establish handshaking by sending
the following message to the client: SJSU_CMPE127_YourName_YourID. Then the client 
will capture this message and print it on its console. 
   
2. Then the client will send the following message to the host as an acknowledgement: 
SJSU_CMPE127_YourName_YourID_Client. The host will then capture this message and 
print it on its console. 

3. Have lab report ready when doing the lab demo, demo without the report will only 
give your partial credit. 

4. The rubrics for this lab is the same as in lab 1 through 3, which has been posted 
since lab 1 assignment.
